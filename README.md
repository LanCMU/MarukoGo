A to-do list plus calendar web application.

We   will   build   a   web   application   that’ll   allow   people   to   organize   personal/working schedules   to   optimize   productivity.   It   is   designed   for   those   who   want   to   control   and optimize   their   time,   especially   for   people   with   an   intensive   daily   routine.   Basically,   it’s like   a   merger   of   Google   Calendar   and   Google   Tasks.   Main   user   cases   would   be   like   :   1) for   different   categories   of   tasks,   users   can   build   different   calendars   to   manage   daily schedules   and   keep   track   of   the   tasks   on   daily,   weekly   or   monthly   basis.   2)   users   can set   tasks   with   due   dates   and   check   them   in   chunks   listed   in   chronological   order.   3)   the system   allows   users   to   organize   tasks,   like   sorting   by   due   date   or   adding   reminders   so that   no   deadline   is   missed.   4)   after   works   have   been   done,   users   can   review   visualized statistics   in   form   of   graphs   to   check   their   time   management   status.   5).   when   events   with reminders   approach,   the   system   will   send   a   notification   to   the   user   screen.
